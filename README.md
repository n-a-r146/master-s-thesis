# The Framing of the Syrian Refugee Crisis: A comparative dynamic analysis of the years 2014 - 2018

This code was used for my Master's Thesis 'The Framing of the Syrian Refugee Crisis'

To prepare the data for the data manipulation and the automatic detection task, firstly, the iPython notebook 'preproceesing.ipynb' needs to be executed. The directory variables have to be adjusted if you want to run the code successfully. After the pre-processing, the notebook 'EDA_Language_Model', which contains the code for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the compilation of the language model, can be executed. Again, the input and output (if one wants to save the output to an external file) directories need to be adjusted accordingly.
